Supermarket Management Application
(C# – Windows Forms)

Associated with: University Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Course

Developed a conceptual supermarket management application using C# (Windows Forms) as part of an academic OOP course.
This project was designed to demonstrate core object-oriented programming principles through a structured and practical application, rather than simulating a real-world commercial system.

Application Overview:
🛒 The supermarket is divided into three main sections:
* Dairy
* Meat
* Groceries

🛠️ Core functionalities include:
* Adding single and multiple products
* Adding items to a shopping cart
* Resetting the system state
* Multi-form user interface with clear and intuitive navigation

Object-Oriented Programming Concepts Applied:
🔐 Encapsulation – Secure handling of application data using private fields and controlled public methods
🧬 Inheritance – Specialized product and section classes derived from common base classes to improve code reuse
🔁 Polymorphism – Dynamic behavior of shared methods across different product and section types
🎭 Abstraction – Hiding complex operations behind clean, well-defined interfaces for better maintainability

Additional Technical Features:
⚙️ Event-driven programming model
✔️ Robust input validation
❌ Clean and user-friendly application shutdown handling
