Supermarket Management system
(C# – Windows Forms)

Developed a conceptual Supermarket Management Application using C# (Windows Forms) as part of a university course on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
This academic project was designed to demonstrate core OOP principles through a structured, practical application rather than to simulate a real-world commercial system.

Application Overview:
The supermarket is divided into three main sections: 🛒
• Dairy
• Meat
• Groceries

🛠️ Core functionalities include:
• Adding single and multiple products
• Adding items to a shopping cart
• Resetting the system state
• Multi-form user interface with clear and intuitive navigation

Object-Oriented Programming Concepts Applied:
🔐 Encapsulation – Secure handling of application data using private fields and controlled public methods
🧬 Inheritance – Specialized product and section classes derived from common base classes to improve code reuse
🔁 Polymorphism – Dynamic behavior of shared methods across different product and section types
🎭 Abstraction – Hiding complex operations behind clean, well-defined interfaces for better maintainability

Additional Technical Features:
⚙️ Event-driven programming model
✔️ Robust input validation
❌ Clean and user-friendly application shutdown handling
